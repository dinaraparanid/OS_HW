Both experiments show that children processes are created
in the amount as the command line arguments are passed.
No additional side effects were introduced in 'pstree' command.
Same results were obtained for both immediate children processes
(print message and finish) and long time processes (with sleep 30s).

Output for the 3 children processes:

┬─bash───bash─┬─bash───ex3───3*[ex3]
│             └─pstree

Output for the 5 children processes:

┬─bash───bash─┬─bash───ex3───5*[ex3]
│             └─pstree
