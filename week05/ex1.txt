In my case, after running 4 subscribers with their own pipes,
they all received their messages accurately.

However, when we shut down any subscriber and recreate it with a wrong pipe
(2+ processes with pipe #q), they are starting to collapse
after trying to simultaneously read a pipe's content.

It happens due to the fact that pipe's pointer is moving concurrently.
So, in order to correctly synchronize all processes,
each of them should use its own pipe.
