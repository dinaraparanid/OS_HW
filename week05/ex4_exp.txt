Results for ex4 show almost identical picture in the sense of performance improvement.
Performance increases due to the fact that tasks become smaller and smaller,
but at the end time for communication and scheduling of threads start to take too much time

What was not so unexpected is that the general performance in ex4 is better than in ex3.
I think it is due to the fact that solution in ex4 does not require any additional
preparations (range distribution between tasks, memory allocations, etc.),
but just shared mutability itself.

The last case with 100 threads makes clear that synchronizing too many threads
is not a good option for the performance, since we start to waste too much
time on the communication and scheduling of threads
