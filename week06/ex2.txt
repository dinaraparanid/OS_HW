1) After changing value of TRI_BASE to 100, from the scheduling point of view nothing was changed.
However, workers found significantly more triangular numbers: in the 1-st case it was not greater than 10,
in the 2-nd case, there were hundreds of such numbers

2) After changing all arrival times to zero, all processes were scheduled by their indices in ascending order.
It is due to the fact that they were additionally sorted by their indices (as mentioned in the task condition).

Previous order: 4, 3, 5, 0, 1, 6, 2.
New order: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
