Results of this task are highly dependent on the provided quantum.
As practise shows, quantum equal to 1 second gives more control and better throughput
than other quantum values (considering that we use integer seconds).

Results for quantum = 1 sec:
    runtime: 32 secs
    order: 4, 5, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
    avg_wt=4.571429
    avg_tat=8.857142

As it can be seen, firstly, we wait for the first process to handle (4),
then we switch to the quickest processes so far (5 and 0),
then we continue with ready process (4) until the first new arrive,
then we handle quickest processes left according to their burst time

Average performance was improved due to the smartest scheduling from all 3 exercises,
runtime has not changed.
