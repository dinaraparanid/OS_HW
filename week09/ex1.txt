Hit ratio for random:
    Small input (lab 8): 0.692308
    Big input (lab 9): 0.611995

Hit ratio for nfu:
    Small input: 0.642857
    Big input: 0.615385

Hit ratio for aging:
    Small input: 0.642857
    Big input: 0.615385

As it can be seen, a hit ratio for random page selection is chaotic and unpredictable,
however, after many launches the resulting distribution is in [0.5..0.7]

As for nfu and aging algorithms, there is no difference between them in the sense of hit/miss.
I suppose that it is due to the fact that almost all pages were used 2 or 3 times in input,
meaning that different counter strategies do not really affect the distribution,
since the load on the pages is almost identical
