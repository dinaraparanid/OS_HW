Explanations:

Due to the fact that the task conditions clearly indicate the implementation of the search for free memory,
using only array's data, i.e., without additional data structures (for example, a linked list),
the best-fit and worst-fit algorithms lag far behind first-fit.

The task did not mention a specific way to find the location of the address to delete,
so the implementation of my algorithm uses a global hash table from search.h to quickly clear the address memory.
A linked list of addresses was additionally used to deallocate the entire memory.
