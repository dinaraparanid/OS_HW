2) No, monitor has not reported modification event for myfile13.txt,
because /tmp/myfile1.txt is not in the watched directory,
meaning that it will not track link update if it is not in the watched directory.
However, monitor tracked change for the watched directory itself.

3) After removing all duplicates with the same inode,
only 2 hard links remained: myfile11.txt itself and /tmp/myfile1.txt,
because it is not in the watched directory.
myfile13.txt was not removed since it is a soft link with a different inode.
